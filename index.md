## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/marc-delacruz/tcmggroup6site/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/marc-delacruz/tcmggroup6site/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### About Us



Howdy! My name is Marc De La Cruz and I am a Technology Management major from Houston, TX. I enjoy eating Nachos or Chicken Alfredo. Whenever I have some time for myself, I like to listen to music or play video games on my Xbox. An interesting fact about me is that my favorite shows to watch on Netflix include Outer Banks and Black Mirror. Another interesting fact is that I enjoy traveling. My favorite place that I went to would have to be Rome because I enjoyed learning about the history of the Roman Empire and I also liked the architecture of each historical building in that city.
